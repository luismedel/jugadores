An old project from my first year at university that I recovered from a dusty backup disk.

It was 1999 and I was tasked to make a simple dabatase-like program to manage a soccer  team's players, as a learning exercise on linked lists. I had been programming since I was 10 years and user defined data types were well known by me, so I decided to bit the bullet and try to test myself against something more advanded.

I ended writing a basic windowing system for DOS in Turbo Pascal, with a very Delphi like API.

One of the source files (gui_btns.pas) is corrupted and I'm unable to recompile the program again but fortunately I found a compiled binary in the same disk. To see it in action, you have to run the included .exe in DosBox ([VirusTotal analysis](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/1b5272064572094a0a2263d7863de88bdc2495ec33728137bd77238ebebeb83d/detection)).
